Welcome to the Facebook PE University Recruiting Linux Challenge

To get started:
1. Please run the following, filling in with your name and email address:
   echo "Your Name <your@email.address>" > ~/OWNERS.txt

Now that we know a little about you, we've got three challenges for you today,
but first an introduction.

# LOG INSPECTOR

If you've ever managed a production service before you know that sometimes
your service may start having problems.  Ideally these are being logged to
a logfile:

  1. maybe someone deployed some bad code
  2. or the behavior of one of your dependencies changed (like a database server)
  3. or something changed with the way your users are using your service.

A common strategy for tracking down errors with your service is to begin by
isolating the start time.  Within Facebook we typically would start by looking
at service metrics on dashboards.  For this exercise, we'll start by looking
directly at the service logs.

Today's challenge will be to build a *log inspector* to handle this task.
You can find the instructions for each in the following man pages.  We recommend
you do them in this order:

* count_404s
* timerange_5xx
* histogram

To read a man page, simply run the *man* command, e.g.::

  $ man count_404s

As a bonus, we've included an additional exercise we won't be talking about
tonight, but you can try at home if you so choose:

* find_bad_push


* Tip: use the utility `cat` to print the contents of a file to your screen,
       for example, to display these instructions again, run::

  $ cat ~/README.first


Good luck!  And thanks for Participating
